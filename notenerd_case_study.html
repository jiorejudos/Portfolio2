                  </div>
                    <p>It was surprising that people didn’t really think about the issue of
                      organizing their bookmarks and notes more. I feel like showing the
                      features really made people see the benefits of the app. In surveying
                      potential users, I think a search function is really a critical feature
                      to add to the app in the future. One of the potential issues in creating
                      another note-taking app was standing out from the competition. However,
                      this product differentiates itself with its ability to better organize
                      different types of information. </p>
                    <p>In the second version, I would add the ability to mark content as a
                      favorite, share on social media and add collaborators. For future versions,
                       I would like to add the ability to set reminders, clip screenshots, a
                       search function and speech-to-text for note-taking. </P>
