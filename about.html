      <div class="aboutBio-text">
        <p>When, I started my college career I wanted to learn to tell a story.
          I choose to join the journalism school to University of Missouri - Columbia.
          There I discovered I could learn to tell a story visually through design, and
          I have been working on honing my skills as a designer ever since.</p>
          <p>I started out my career in the fast-paced newspaper business. As a graphic
            designer, I have spent my career working with different software programs,
            and I like picking up new applications. I also enrolled in the Bloc bootcamp
            to increase my design skills by learning web design.</p>
            <p>I really enjoy creating clean, elegant print and web designs, and I am
              looking forward to finding another position that will challenge my abilities.</p>
