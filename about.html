       <p> <br>When, I started my college career I wanted to learn to tell a
         story. I choose to join the journalism school to University of
         Missouri - Columbia. There I discovered I could learn to tell a
         story visually through design, and I have been working on
         honing my skills as a designer ever since.</br><br>
          I started out my career in the fast-paced newspaper business.
          As a graphic designer, I have spent my career working with
          ifferent software programs, and I like picking up new
          applications. I also enrolled in the Bloc bootcamp to increase
          my design skills by learning web design.</br><br>
          I really enjoy creating clean, elegant print and web designs, and
          I am looking forward to finding another position that will
          challenge my abilities. </br></p>
