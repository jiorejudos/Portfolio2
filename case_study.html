         <h2>About the Project</h2>
       <p>Several apps to search for food trucks exist, but there is not a well-designed
         solution that integrates payment solutions. This app allows users to discover
         food trucks in there area, select food and purchase.</p>

        <h2>User Surveys</h2>
        <p>I created a survey to find out more about who would be using
          this app.</p>
          <div class="userSurvey-text-block">
            <h3>100%</h3>
            <p>I found that everyone I surveyed was interested in an app
              that would help them search for food trucks. </p>

          <div class="userSurvey-text-block">
            <h3>50%</h3>
            <p>Half the respondents, were interested in ordering and paying in the app. </p>

          <div class="userSurvey-text-block">
            <h3>25%</h3>
            <p>Respondents were also interested in having reviews of the food trucks,
            so I made sure to include that in my app. </p>
