          foodtrucks in there area, select food and purchase.</p>

                      added a tagline on the loading screen to clarify. I also added a page
                      to confirm the order, so that users have a chance to cancel order if
                      they need to make a change to it. These changes made for a better user
                      experience.<p>
                    <p>Something I would do differently in the future, is to test the app on more
                      users. Having feedback from a larger variety of users would help
                      ensure that the app is as user-friendly as possible.</p>
