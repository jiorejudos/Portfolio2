       <p>Several apps to search for food trucks exist, but there is not a well-designed
         solution that integrates payment solutions. This app allows users to discover
         food trucks in there area, select food and purchase.</p>

          <h2>What I learned doing this project?</h2>
          <p>I learned the importance of getting feedback through the process. When
            the testers were a bit confused at first on what the app could do, I
            added a tagline on the loading screen to clarify. I also added a page
            to confirm the order, so that users have a chance to cancel order if
            they need to make a change to it. These changes made for a better user
            experience.<p>
          <p>Something I would do differently in the future, is to test the app on more
            users. Having feedback from a larger variety of users would help
            ensure that the app is as user-friendly as possible.</p>
