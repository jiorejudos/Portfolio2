        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to design a web application for people to crowdfund
          donations for charities, and allow people to donate to specific causes. I focused
          on a site specifically for donating to Christian missions and ministries. There are
          not as many web apps out there focused on missions and there are specific features
          that are helpful for those in missions. </p>

              <br><p><h5>Weaknesses</h5> - GiveSendGo requires a photo to start an account. YouCaring could use better social sharing optimization. Funded by Faith is only for churches, not for other Christian non-profits.</p></br>

                    <p>It was surprising that people didn’t really think about the issue of
                      organizing their bookmarks and notes more. I feel like showing the
                      features really made people see the benefits of the app. In surveying
                      potential users, I think a search function is really a critical feature
                      to add to the app in the future. One of the potential issues in creating
                      another note-taking app was standing out from the competition. However,
                      this product differentiates itself with its ability to better organize
                      different types of information. </p>
                    <p>In the second version, I would add the ability to mark content as a
                      favorite, share on social media and add collaborators. For future versions,
                       I would like to add the ability to set reminders, clip screenshots, a
                       search function and speech-to-text for note-taking. </P>
