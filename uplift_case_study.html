      <p>The purpose of this project was to design a web application for people to crowdfund
        donations for charities, and allow people to donate to specific causes. I focused
        on a site specifically for donating to Christian missions and ministries. There are
        not as many web apps out there focused on missions and there are specific features
        that are helpful for those in missions. </p>

                              <p>As I created the prototypes and went through usability testing, I found
                                that users liked the concept, a fundraising site aimed at missions was
                                a unique approach. Some test participants took a little bit to figure out
                                what the site was for, so I moved up the tagline so users see that right away.
                                Also on the donation page, I added a progress tracker so that the user can
                                where they are in the process. This performed well in user testing. On the homepage in
                                the Why Uplift? section, users asked for more details, so I added information.</p>

                                <p>The goal of UpLift was to make a web app that made the donation process easy. As a fundraiser
                                  on UpLift, the user needs to be able to easily commuinate with
                                  donators, so I included the ability to email donators. Also the donor can choose to
                                  receive a tax-deductible-donation letter, this also makes the donation process
                                  easier for fundraisers.</p>

                                  <p>In this project, I learned the importance of making sure the steps a user needs
                                    to take are straightforward. When an UpLift users goes through the donation process, I wanted
                                    to make sure the user knew what steps to take. I added a progress bar, to make that clearer
                                    for the donator.</p>
                                    <p>In order for a crowdfunding site to be useful for a fundraiser, it really needs
                                      to make the process of getting donations easier. So I added a clear spreadsheet of
                                      who the donors were and how much they had given. This helps fundraisers keep track
                                      of donators. This page also tracks wether they have sent out a thank you note to the
                                      donor or not.</p>
