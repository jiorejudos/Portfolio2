              <br><p><h5>Weaknesses</h5> - The Sock Drawer has lots of steps to the checkout process. Sock It To Me and Happy Socks could use better search filter
              options.</p></br>
              <br><p><h5>Opportunities</h5> - All the sites had lots of fun sock, but not a lot of atheletic or dress socks.</p></br>

              <p>When building The Cozy Toes look, I wanted it to fell warm and comfortable. I choose an analogous color scheme with warm colors to show that harmony.
              The logo uses the Poplar font because it is a good display face with lots of simplicity. </p>

                  <p>As I created the prototypes and went through usability testing, I found
                    that users liked the font, the name and logo. Generally, people seemed
                    to say that it was fairly simple and easy to use. Some test participants
                    were confused about all the website could do, which points to a need to
                    have a detailed FAQ section for new and potential users.</p>

                    <h2>What I learned doing this project?</h2>
                  </div>
                    <p>It was surprising that people didn’t really think about the issue of
                      organizing their bookmarks and notes more. I feel like showing the
                      features really made people see the benefits of the app. In surveying
                      potential users, I think a search function is really a critical feature
                      to add to the app in the future. One of the potential issues in creating
                      another note-taking app was standing out from the competition. However,
                      this product differentiates itself with its ability to better organize
                      different types of information. </p>
                    <p>In the second version, I would add the ability to mark content as a
                      favorite, share on social media and add collaborators. For future versions,
                       I would like to add the ability to set reminders, clip screenshots, a
                       search function and speech-to-text for note-taking. </P>
