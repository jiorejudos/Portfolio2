              <p>I analyzed three different online stores – The Sock Drawer, Sock It To Me, Happy Socks – to see what kind of

              <br><p><h5>Weaknesses</h5> - The Sock Drawer has lots of steps to the checkout process. Sock It To Me and Happy Socks could use better search filter

              <p>When building The Cozy Toes look, I wanted it to fell warm and comfortable. I choose an analogous color scheme with warm colors to show that harmony.
              The logo uses the Poplar font because it is a good display face with lots of simplicity. </p>

                  <p>As I created the prototypes and went through usability testing, I found
                    that users liked the tagline and that there were a lot of images of different
                    socks on the homepage. It was very clear from the beginning what the shop sold.
                    I also received feedback that many shoppers liked to have a quick add feature.
                    This was they could easily add something to the cart without anymore steps.
                    So I added that to the final product.</p>

                    <p>I learned the importance of surveying users before the process. I wish I would
                    have done a survey of users preferences for the checkout process. I think the
                    checkout process turned out well, but it would have been better to get that feedback at the
                    beginning to make sure that it was clear.</p>
                    <p>In the second version, I would like to add a link to the sock brand on the product
                    detail page. So, if a user has a brand they prefer, they can find other socks of the same brand.</p>
