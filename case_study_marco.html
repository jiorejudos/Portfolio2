      <h2>Marco Mobile App</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Marco is a road trip planning app. It was born out of many trips that I have taken and struggled
      to find a convenient restaurant along my way. Many map apps search around a certain area, so you
      don't necessarily find something in the direction the driver is traveling. Marco searches along
      the route. The user can also save the itinerary for later. Users also get detailed information
      of the businesses along with reviews.</p>

                              to get to the search along route feature, so the text “search along route”
                              was added to the search field. The user experience could still be improved,

                              add a destination.

                            to find “Reviews” at the bottom of the page. Based on user feedback, the “reviews”
                            link is in the middle of the screen. This makes it clearer for the testers. In the
                             final version, there is one more slight change to the design. The “Reviews” link
                             is now “My Reviews”, which makes it even clearer for the users.

                            In the first version, everything is at the top of the screen. In the next
                            version, the text fields and the button are lower to make the button more
                            easily accessible for users. Some users didn’t see the button at the bottom
                            of the screen. So in the final version, everything is in the middle. This
                            tested well on users.

                                <p>While designing this app, I learned to spend more time thinking through
                                  the user experience. It took a lot of testing and many different versions
                                  to get the user flow done well. I also found out that it was often
                                  important to talk to testers in person. Without talking to testers, it is
                                  difficult to understand why they are making certain choices. When I asked
                                  users to search along a route, I was able to ask where they would expect
                                  to find the feature. I was then able to try different options, and test
                                  them until the users found the flow easier. Discussing it with them helped
                                  to gather more information on how to improved the experience.</p>
